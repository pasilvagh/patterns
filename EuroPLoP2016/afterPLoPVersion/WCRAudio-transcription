Web Content Renderer Audio

Summary:
- Introduces a pattern that is part of a bigger pattern system problem.
- The web browser and this pattern called Web Content Renderer pattern, and how to process resources to show them and to process them.

What was liked?
- Liked the idea of writting a web browsers architecture based on patterns
- Purpose of diagrams and illustrations, they show exactly how this particular pattern fits into the whole scheme of the browser.
- The forces and consequences of the pattern are aligned
- Even thought the pattern is very complex into answers into a lots of components, its structures and the dynamics; it was easy to understand. It didn't take too much time to understand what's going on here. 
- Not an expert in web browsers, neither in web applications. But after rendering, could understand how the web browsers renders. Greatest strenght of the paper.

Suggestions
- Title: al the content renderer are like this, so is "THE" pattern...is a generic pattern that describes on the first step	how the web content renderer works
	- Sub content renderer pattern -> reason: not really well understood by the audio...
	- The pattern does not go into many specific details -> 90% this could represent the renderer.
- Abstract:
	- Bit long
	- Promises to talk about security, which is stated as a concern. The security was not addressed. Take it out or add one section to talk about it.
	- Because the security is embbeded in the whole reference architecure, not to this pattern, this to be mentioned more precisely.
	- Security is a constant in this pattern. The pattern is compared to the Gateway pattern (single point of acceess to resources)
		- Suggest: a computer threat modelling content browser of the web content renderer. Is one place where shows security that single point, is that single point is enough?
	- why the abstracts only mentions google chrome? all browser have evolved. why is only referenced? -> needs comparisson.
	- describes the bigger work in the abstract, not the renderer. No need to explain what a web browser is to developers.
		- Suggestion: describe a little bit the context of the work, but then focus only in the pattern of the renderer. To decide if I want to read it or not.

-Introduction:
	- Suggestion: put in the beggining what is the paper about. Last parragraph oof the introduction needs to be early.
	- The introduction confused the attendees, they thought we would talk more about more patterns, but is just one in the end.
	- Where this patterns originated from? sourcecode? where comes from?? documentation? Which browsers are this patterns?
	- This patterns are for mobile or desktop browsers? ...needs to be said explicitely
	- Figure 1, what are the colors from? use a legend! Says web browser content renderer...should be web content renderer! (to maintain same nomination)
	- Some explanation of the browser reference architecture is missing to understand context.
	- Suggestion: talk more about the reference architecture, information is missing and relationship with the WCR is not understood on the paper.

	Paulina's comments:
	- The patterns diagram was not very well understood by the attendees, they did not understood how it works. They were called "ombrella patterns", as an intro patterns.
	- They thought that a browser could only be a renderer (text-based browser), which is not entirely wrong. But still, the idea of the browser is to have a renderer and a browser kernel at least.
	- Someone did not understood why the browser renderer was separated from the browser.

-Pattern
	- Context, Problem and Intent may be similar.
		-What's is the problem?
			-Why separate renderer?
		-Multiple tabs, to separate them (isolate them), to others to still work if others cant.
			-separation of concerns.
	- Is not clear the pattern

	- "appropiate tools" page 3.
	- suggestion: write more explicitely about what the problem is. is about tools to display in various formats...
	- the solution is the renderer and tools, and interactions. They are missing over the solution. Explain what happens when a web browser does not have a renderer.
	- why separate the renderer from the browser? -> someone says they could use the WCR embedded to build a desktop app.
	-What are other use cases? just 2 more?
	-Forces section: Stability? maybe another word.
	- Figure 4, step 15. Lack a return arrow before step 15.
	- Implementation part seems like examples. Wording issues...seems more like known uses.
	- Google -> Google Chrome, dont use companies names.
	- Talk about related standars in the introduction.
	- talk about the renderer engine before as the web content renderer, so it will be understtod as the same entity.
	- label liabilities.
	- examples resolved is not really helpful.
	- explain well what is to "navigate more smoothly"
	- move the glossary to the beginning or mention it at the beginning.

	Paulina's comments
	-Security related to the pattern made difficult to the attendees to understand the pattern (implementation section)
	- not really well understood why is faster or secure

Closing remarks:
	-Nice to have this overview, is good to people who want to work with web browsers.
	-The paper nicely describes a relatively complex subject, and we (attendee) who read about it I got some understanding. But maybe there is confusion between this pattern and the reference architecture it comes from
	- Take another look into describe well the problem.
