Abstract:

- a long abstract
- Abstract not talking much about web content renderer
- Last parragraph: How is Chrome related?
- Not cler which problems you are going to address (You are talking about security, achitecture, documentation, communication between components...)
- Weak. I expect to see more concrete information of what new features in chrome address this pattern.

Introduction:
- Where do tese patterns originated? Where they have been witnessed? (Figure 1).
- Some short intro to patterns.
- Goal?
- Not sure wht this pattern is about until next page.
- Last parragraf should be in the beginning.
- add legend to colors in Figure 1

Pattern:
- What is the problem? not very good example.

	Problem:
		- Each f these sound like a problem to its own patterns.
		- Seems like context
		- Stability for Resilence or Tolerance.
		- Add "Security": Rendering the content should not expose, or in any way, hinder the security of the client.
		- This could be formulated more clearly

	Solution:
		- Core of solution?
		- Too vague to be useful.
		- What functions?
		- Which other use cases exists?
		- In Figure 3, would like to have the web resource aligned in the diagram.
		- Who told the Frame Constructor (Figure 4) to generate (the) Renderered View at this time? Is the answer of the JsEngine missing? Is it renering during manipulation?

	Implementation:
		- Does not get clear before, that every request gets its own instance.

	Consequences:
		- Stability: Whis was not really discussed in the pattern.
		- Conflict between stability and Timeliness.

	Example Resolved:
		- Too general to be useful.
		- Value of the section?
		- Not clear from description

- How security aspects were tackeled within the pattern?

Conclusions:
	- You are talking about security and attacks but you do not provide information about why it is getting better when sing your architecture.|
