contrib/ACM-Reference-Format-Journals.bst  - Alternative bibliography style for

                       standard ACM bibliography style with some adaptations
                       applied to enhance its compatibility with bibliography
                       database files created with babelbib in mind.
                       Especially supports "urldate" field as an additional
                       alternative to "lastaccessed".
                       Far from perfect---so after finally running BibTeX,
                       the generated *.bbl file might need some
                       manual editing to get capitalization right.
contrib/acmlarge-sample.tex  - LaTeX document of sample with tiny additions
                       taken from Babelbib to make it work with
