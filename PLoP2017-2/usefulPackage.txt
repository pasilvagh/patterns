LaTeX packages useful for formatting PLoP submissions
-----------------------------------------------------

All of these packages are available from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
(CTAN) <http://www.ctan.org/>. Many LaTeX distributions already include some
of them, so you do not have to download these separately.

booktabs             - LaTeX package improving the look of tables
flafter              - LaTeX package to enforce the contents of floating
                       environments---figures and tables are the default LaTeX
                       floating environments---not to be printed before the
                       definition of the floating environment.

                         Floats,_Figures_and_Captions#
                         Keeping_floats_in_their_place>.
glossaries           - LaTeX package to create glossaries
graphicx             - LaTeX package for including graphic files
hyperref             - LaTeX package that creates hyperlinks to \cite, \ref
                       etc. and allows for outbound links to arbitrary URLs
                       via \href and \url. In case of long URLs consider also
                       using the breakurl LaTeX package.
isodate              - LaTeX package to pretty print dates according to
                       ISO 8601. Internationalized with support for several
                       Locales
longtable            - LaTeX package for automatically page breaking tables
numprint             - LaTeX package to format numbers and quantities. Easy
                       to use---more challenging contexts might call
                       for siunitx instead.
siunitx              - More involved alternative to LaTeX package numprint
subcaption           - LaTeX package to lay out subfigures, -tables etc.
