Manual on adaptations for fomatting PLoP submissions
----------------------------------------------------

In addition to the contents of "acmlarge-guide.pdf" the following applies:

Add "hillsideplop" to the optional parameters in the "\documentclass" command.
This sets the correct journal name in the output.

Set "\acmVolume", "\acmYear", and "\acmMonth". These set the volume, conference
year and month in the journal line in the output.

Add as many "\category" lines as you want and a "\terms" line. Please refer to
<http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998> for the respective 1998 ACM Computing
Classification System. Also add "\keywords". This has also been described in
Section 2.2 (Content Indicators and Keywords) of "acmlarge-guide.pdf".

Add a self-reference in terms of the "\acmformat" command. This has also been
described in Section 2.2 (Content Indicators and Keywords) of "acmlarge-guide.pdf".

Add the copyright notice and ISBN as told you by the conference chair in terms of the "\copyr" command.

Add the permission statement also given by the conference chair as the
trailing part of the contents of the "bottomstuff" environment.

Add the history dates in terms of the "\received" command, namely the date of
initial submission, the date of the conference version and the date of the
version after having considered Writers' Workshop feedback.


Some of these data will not be available until after the conference. In this case substitute words for the required information the clearly indicate the preliminary status, e.g. "TODO".


If you are using MikTeX, and the LaTeX compiler prints errors probably
originating from outdated packages even after you thought you had updated them,
a potential cause might be the interaction of MikTeX user mode and
administrative mode - packages updated in administrative mode might be
shadowed by old packages installed in user mode. See e. g.
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/67712/difference-between-administrative-and-user-mode-of-miktex> (Retrieved August 6, 2014). The author of these
lines e.g. once had a failure regarding package "fontenc" loaded by
"acmlarge.cls", that vanished after having considered the meaning of user and
administrative modes.
